# Day 1

## Tasks Completed

1. **Monolithic - MicroServices task**

   - Create a 3 tier monolithic app which has Frontend-Backend-Database all tightly coupled in one, and then migrate that app to microservice architecture, using docker where frontend service will be public, both backend and database will be private and connecting with each other.

2. **Repository Migration**

   - Migrate the AWS CodeCommit Repository to the any Git Provider with all best practices (GitHub/ Azure DevOps/ Gitlab, etc.,)

3. **Programming Language Modernization/Migration Task**

   - Your primary objective is to modernize the backend of the legacy ToDo App, currently implemented in JSP-Servlet. You may convert it to .NET, Java Spring Boot, or Python-whichever platform you are most comfortable with. If time permits, you can also work on modernizing the UI.
